If you¡¯ve followed the steps in Section 1.3.4, you might notice that GitHub automatically shows the contents of the README file on the main repository page. In our case, since the project is a Rails application generated using the rails command, the README file is the one that comes with Rails (Figure 1.9). This isn¡¯t very helpful, so in this section we¡¯ll make our first edit by changing the README to describe our project rather than the Rails framework itself. In the process, we¡¯ll see a first example of the branch, edit, commit, merge workflow that I recommend using with Git.
